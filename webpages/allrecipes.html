            <p class="recipe-text"> 
                Ingredients:<br>
                <br>
                1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
                2 tablespoons sugar<br>
                1 tablespoon baking powder<br>
                1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
                1 egg<br>
                1 cup milk<br>
                2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil<br>
                1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)<br><br>
                Instructions:<br><br>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
                In another bowl, beat the egg and then stir in the milk, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract (if using).<br>
                Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.
                Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.<br>
                Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
                Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.<br>
                Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown on both sides.
                Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.<br>
                Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.<br><br>
                Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!</p>

            <h1> JUCIES </h1>
            <p class="recipe-text"> Ingredients:<br><br>
                Assorted fruits (e.g., oranges, apples, grapes, strawberries, pineapple, watermelon, etc.)<br>
                Water or ice cubes (optional)<br>
                Sweetener such as honey, sugar, or agave syrup (optional)<br><br>
                Instructions:<br><br>
                Wash all the fruits thoroughly under running water.<br>
                Peel and chop the fruits into small pieces, removing any seeds or pits.
                Place the chopped fruits into a blender or juicer.
                If desired, add a little water or ice cubes to help with blending and to adjust the consistency of the juice.<br>
                Blend the fruits until smooth. If using a juicer, follow the manufacturer's instructions.
                Taste the juice and add sweetener if desired. Blend again to combine.<br>
                Strain the juice through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any pulp or solids, if preferred.
                Transfer the juice to a pitcher or serving glasses.<br>
                Serve the juice immediately over ice, or refrigerate it for later.
                Stir the juice before serving, as natural separation may occur over time.<br><br>
                Enjoy your refreshing homemade fruit juice! You can customize the recipe by using your favorite fruits or by adding herbs like mint or basil for extra flavor. Adjust the sweetness according to your taste preferences.

1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour<br>
12 Oreo cookies, chopped<br>
Instructions:<br><br>
Preheat Oven:<br>

Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with aluminum foil. This prevents water from leaking into the pan during the water bath.<br>
Crush Oreos:<br>

Crush 24 Oreos in a food processor until they become fine crumbs. Alternatively, place them in a plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a mixing bowl.<br>
Mix Crumbs with Butter:<br>

Add melted butter to the Oreo crumbs and mix until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared springform pan to form the crust.<br>
Prepare Filling:<br>

In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth using an electric mixer. Add granulated sugar and vanilla extract, and beat until creamy.<br>
Add Eggs:<br>

Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br>
Add Sour Cream and Heavy Cream:<br>

Mix in sour cream and heavy cream until smooth and creamy. Add flour and mix until just combined.<br>
Fold in Chopped Oreos:<br>

Gently fold in the chopped Oreos into the cheesecake batter.<br>
Pour Batter into Pan:<br>

Pour the cheesecake batter over the Oreo crust in the springform pan.<br>
Bake:<br>

Place the springform pan into a larger baking pan or roasting pan. Fill the larger pan with hot water halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This creates a water bath for even baking and prevents cracking.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly.<br>
Cool and Chill:<br><br>
Serve:<br>

Before serving, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Slice and enjoy!

            <H1> SAMOSA </H1>
            <p class="recipe-text"> Ingredients:<br><br>
                 2 large potatoes, boiled, peeled, and mashed<br>
                1/2 cup (75g) green peas, boiled<br>
                1 small onion, finely chopped<br>
                2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)<br>
                1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste<br>
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br>
                1 teaspoon coriander powder<br>
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
                1/2 teaspoon garam masala<br>
                1/2 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder)<br>
                Salt, to taste<br>
                Instructions:<br><br>
                Making the dough:<br>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.<br>
                Add the vegetable oil or melted ghee and mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.<br>
                Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead to form a smooth and firm dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br>
                Making the filling:<br>
                Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.<br>
                Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.<br>
                Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and sauté for a minute.
                Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, amchur, and salt. Mix well.<br>
                Add mashed potatoes and boiled green peas. Mix until well combined.<br>
                Cook the filling for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add chopped coriander leaves, mix well, and remove from heat. Allow the filling to cool completely.<br>
                Assembling and frying the samosas:<br>
                Divide the rested dough into small lemon-sized balls. Roll each ball into a smooth ball between your palms.<br>
                Roll out each dough ball into a thin oval or circular shape.<br>
                Cut the rolled dough in half to form two semi-circles.
                Take one semi-circle, brush water along the straight edge, and form a cone shape by overlapping the straight edges and pressing to seal.<br>
                Fill the cone with the prepared potato filling, leaving some space at the top.
                Brush water along the open edge and press to seal and secure the samosa.<br>
                Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling to make more samosas.<br>
                Frying the samosas:<br>
                Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat.
                Once the oil is hot, gently slide in the prepared samosas, a few at a time, without overcrowding the pan.<br>
                Fry the samosas until they turn golden brown and crisp on all sides, turning occasionally. This may take about 8-10 minutes.
                Once fried, remove the samosas using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.<br>
                Serve hot with mint chutney, tamarind chutney, or ketchup.<br>
                Enjoy your homemade samosas as a delicious snack or appetizer!</p>
